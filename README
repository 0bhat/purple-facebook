Purple Facebook implements the Facebook Messenger protocol into pidgin,
finch, and libpurple. While the primary implementation is for purple3,
this plugin is back-ported for purple2.

## Installing Prebuilt Binaries

Precompiled binaries can be downloaded from the releases section of
GitHub. Then follow the generic instructions provided on the Pidgin
website.

## Building and Installing

Make sure glib, json-glib, libpurple (pidgin), and zlib are installed
with their headers and development information. If these packages came
from the distribution's repository, they will likely need additional
development packages, usually suffixed with -dev.

    $ git clone https://github.com/jgeboski/purple-facebook.git
    $ cd purple-facebook
    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ make

With a "global" (or system) installation:

    $ make install

Or with a "local" installation:

    $ mkdir -p ~/.purple/plugins
    $ cp pidgin/libpurple/protocols/facebook/.libs/libfacebook.so ~/.purple/plugins
